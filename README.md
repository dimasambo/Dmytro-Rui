# Code Challenge

I've completed 3 tasks/projects.
1. The first one contains 3 different functions how to get sum to `n`.
2. The second one is a React-ts project with the currency 
converter. There is form with validation and processed 
most of the cases. TS setup is super basic, and 100% should be better.
3. The third project contains edited React-ts code with comments
and explanations. It looks very "red" in code editor,
but imho the main goal is reached :)
